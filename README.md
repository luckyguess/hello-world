# hello-world
This is my first time using github. So let's see how it goes!

I'm currently nearing my end at my University. On path to graduate with a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Math. A little bummed out that I wasn't able to find an internship this summer but hopeful that something good will happen. Fingers crossed and typing out code!
